   xattr -cr "/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins/obs_scene_tree_view.plugin"
   ```
   Then restart OBS Studio.
   
   **Method 3 (System Settings):**
   1. Try to launch OBS with the plugin
   2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
   3. Scroll to the "Security" section

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Appearing in OBS (All Platforms)

**Problem**: The Scene Tree View dock doesn't appear in the Docks menu.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the plugin files are installed in the correct location (see platform-specific sections above)
2. In OBS, enable the dock: **View → Docks → Scene Tree View** (check it)
3. If missing: **View → Docks → Reset UI**, then re-check the dock entry
4. Check OBS logs for clues (Help → Log Files): Look for lines containing `obs_scene_tree_view` and `registered via`
5. Ensure OBS Studio is 32.x+ (Help → About OBS Studio)

### macOS Gatekeeper Issues

**Problem**: macOS blocks the plugin with "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"

**Solution**: Follow the Gatekeeper bypass instructions in the macOS Installation section above (Method 1, 2, or 3)

### Linux Version Mismatch

**Problem**: Plugin fails to load on Linux

**Solution**: Linux requires strict version matching. Ensure the plugin was built against the same libobs version as your OBS installation. You may need to build from source if the pre-built binary doesn't match your OBS version.

### Windows Permission Issues

**Problem**: Cannot copy files to `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\`

**Solution**: Run PowerShell or Command Prompt as Administrator, or use File Explorer with administrator privileges
